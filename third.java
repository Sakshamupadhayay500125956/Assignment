// The error produced by the given recursive code in terms of memory cost is *Stack Overflow*. This occurs because each recursive function call is pushed onto the call stack, and for a large value of num, the recursion depth can exceed the stack limit.

// ### Explanation of the error:
// The function multiply(num) is a recursive implementation of factorial (n!). For large values of num, each function call is stored on the call stack until the base case (num == 1) is reached. If the value of num is very large (say, thousands or more), it may exceed the stack space available for function calls, causing a *stack overflow*.

// ### Solution:
// To avoid this error, we can use *iteration* instead of recursion. An iterative approach will not consume additional stack memory for each function call, thus preventing a stack overflow.

// ### Improved Code:
public static int multiply(int num) {
    int result = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= num; i++) {
        result *= i;
    }
    return result;
}


// ### Time Complexity:
// - *Time Complexity: The time complexity remains **O(n)*, where n is the input number. This is because we iterate from 1 to n and perform a multiplication in each iteration.

// ### Space Complexity:
// - *Space Complexity: The space complexity is **O(1)*, since we are only using a few variables (result and i) to store intermediate values and are not using any additional space that grows with n. The iterative approach saves stack space compared to the recursive version.

//This solution avoids the stack overflow error while maintaining optimal time and space complexity for multiplying n numbers.
